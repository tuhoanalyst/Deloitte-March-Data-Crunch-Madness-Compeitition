## Overview

This project is the submission for the 12th Annual March Data Crunch Madness sponsored by Deloitte. The goal is to predict the NCAA March Madness 2024 Final Four using data science techniques on historical dataset.  

## Data Structure

The dataset contains historical data of preivous year results, with 104 attributes and 1314 records in inconsistent format. 

## Key Features
### Data Cleaning And Preprocessing 

Cleaning data and remove unneccessary columns to optimize the dataset. 

Run correlation analysis to filter variables that would be helpful to build the model. 

Calculate and adding new variables that are relevant to evaluate the winning probability including Distance from hometown to each host location and upset for games between difference seeded team.

### Variable Selection

There are 13 variables with high correlation scores were used for building machine learning models.

### Model Performance 

There are five supervised machine learning models were built to predict the Final Four of the 2024 March Madness Tournament: Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest, XG Boost Tree.
